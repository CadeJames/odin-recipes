    <p>
        Salty, buttery, and slightly sharp, Comté cheese crisps similarly to Parmesan, adding an irresistibly crunchy frico layer to these cheeseburgers. 
        For best results, don't flip the buns straight out of the oven; letting them cool keeps the cheese crispy at the edges and soft in the center.
    </p>
    <H2>Ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces Comté cheese, shredded (about 2 cups), divided</li>
        <li>4 brioche hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup (2 ounces) dry red wine</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Butter lettuce leaves, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <H2>Steps</H2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange 4 (1/4-cup) mounds of cheese on prepared pan spaced 3 inches apart and 11/2 inches from edges. Flatten each mound into a 3-inch circle. Bake in preheated oven just until edges of cheese rounds look dry and lacy, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from oven. Working quickly, place 2 split buns, cut sides down, on top of cheese rounds, and press down. Let stand, undisturbed, 5 minutes. Slide parchment with buns off baking sheet, and let buns stand on parchment, undisturbed, until ready to serve. Line baking sheet with fresh parchment; repeat with remaining cheese and buns.</li>
        <li>While cheese rounds bake, shape beef into 4 (4-inch-wide) patties. Make a slight indentation in center of each patty using your thumb; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring often, until slightly softened and browned around edges, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring often, until softened and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add wine; cook, stirring constantly, until wine is absorbed, about 1 minute. Transfer onion mixture to a small bowl, and wipe skillet clean.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle patties with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and remaining 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, cook patties to desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium. Transfer patties to a plate.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise over cheese on each bottom bun half. Top each with 1 burger patty, 1/4 cup cooked onions, and lettuce. Cover with top buns, cheese sides down.</li>
    </ol>
