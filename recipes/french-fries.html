    <p>
        The perfect french fries recipe! Based on a ground-breaking method from the legendary Kenji López-Alt's The Food Lab, these hot chips are so crispy they stay that way even after they've gone cold. 
        It's rare to find fries this good even at up-market bistros!
    </p>
    <H2>Ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Potato</b> - The type is important. Starchy, floury potatoes are the potatoes you need for crispy fries.</li>
        <li><b>Vinegar</b> - For simmering the potatoes, it is one secret weapon for perfect fries. There is no trace of vinegar flavour once cooked. See Step 4 below for the why.</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b> - For seasoning the water so the potatoes are seasoned all the way through.</li>
        <li><b>Oil</b> - For frying. I use vegetable or canola oil which are neutrally-flavoured oils.</li>
    </ul>
    <H2>Steps</H2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, we have to cut our fries. A neat little crispy fries trick you may not have seen before: use a serrated knife to cut the potatoes. 
            Though not visible to the eye, it makes the surface rougher therefore creating more surface area to crisp up = crispier fries!</li>
        <li>Once all the fries are cut, place in a colander then rinse under tap water for 15 - 20 seconds. 
            This is the first step to remove excess sugars from the surface of the potatoes (more on the “why” of this below, but in short it's to aid crispiness - of course!). 
            Meanwhile, the insides remain untouched by water so they'll cook up nice and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are rinsed, place them in a pot with cold tap water, vinegar and salt. 
            Bring to a boil on high heat then immediately turn down to low so the surface is barely rippling. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a spider or large slotted spoon to remove the potatoes from the water into a colander. Then carefully spread the potatoes out on two tea towel-lined trays to steam dry for 5 minutes.
            No need to pat them dry, the residual heat will do the job for us.</li>
        <li>Fry</li>
    </ol>
