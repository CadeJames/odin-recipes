    <H2>Description</H2>
    <p>
        This cozy soup comes together in just one pot, making it perfect for a fuss-free, flavorful meal. I love making a big batch and keeping it in the fridge for easy lunches or dinners throughout the week!

    <H2>Ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste and Tomatoest</li>
        <li>Garlic, Fennel Seeds, Bay Leaves, & Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>Broth</li>
        <li>Apple Cider Vinegar or Lemon Juice</li>
    </ul>
    <H2>Steps</H2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start your soup with a classic mirepoix (a mix of sautéed onions, carrots, and celery). 
            Adding tomato paste at this stage helps to deepen the flavor and give your soup a richer color.</li>
        <li>Don’t just dump all your spices in at once. After the initial sauté, stir in aromatics like garlic, fennel, salt, and pepper, and cook for a minute. 
            This way, they get a chance to release their flavor into the soup, but won’t burn before adding the liquid.</li>
        <li>Simmering for about 20 minutes is key to getting the vegetables tender. There’s no need to cook much longer than that.</li>
        <li>Ingredients that cook quickly, like frozen peas or spinach, should be added at the end to prevent them from becoming mushy and maintain their bright color and texture.</li>
        <li>Before serving, taste your soup and adjust the seasonings. A splash of apple cider vinegar or fresh lemon juice at the end can brighten up the flavors and make the soup taste less one-dimensional 
            (a problem I’ve had with veggie soups).</li>
    </ol>
